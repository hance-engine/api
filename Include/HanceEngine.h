/** \mainpage HANCE API â€“ C Interface
* 
* The C interface for the HANCE Audio Engine provides developers with simple access to HANCE's
* powerful algorithms and processing capabilities from all languages that offer bindings for
* standard C compatible libraries. The HANCE Audio Engine is a light-weight and cross-platform
* library, and it should be very easy to integrate it into your application. The library can
* load pre-trained AI models and use these for audio processing to perform various tasks such
* as noise reduction and de-reverberation.
*
* The HANCE Audio Engine is delivered with general purpose models for noise reduction and
* de-reverberation. These are designed to meet common requirements in terms of latency and
* CPU usage. However, we can train custom models for lower latencies or less CPU usage
* at the cost of separation quality. Please [contact us](https://hance.ai/contact) for more
* information.
* 
* \section intro_sec Getting Started
* The HANCE API is designed to be as simple as possible. The **ProcessFile** example (see the
* **Examples** folder in the API) illustrates how to create a HANCE processor and process audio
* with it. [CMake 3.0](https://cmake.org/) or later is required to build the example. To build
* **ProcessFile**, open the terminal / command line prompt and locate the Examples/ProcessFile
* subfolder in the HANCE API. Now, please type "./Build.sh" on Mac or Linux, or "Build.bat" on Windows. 
*
* To use the HANCE API, we first need to make sure the "Include" in the HANCE API is added to the
* header search path and include the HanceEngine header file:
* ```
* #include "HanceEngine.h"
* ```
* Now we can create an instance of a HANCE processor by specifying a path to a HANCE model file
* along with the number of channels and sample rate to use:
* ```
* // Create a HANCE processor that loads the pre-trained model from file
* processorHandle = hanceCreateProcessor (modelFilePath, numOfChannels, sampleRate);
* if (processorHandle == nullptr)
*     handleError ("Unable to create the HANCE audio processor.");
* ```
* The processor handle will be nullptr if the processor couldn't be created, e.g., because the
* model file path is invalid.
* 
* Now, we can add audio in floating point format to the HANCE processor. The HANCE API supports
* audio stored either as channel interleaved audio (hanceAddAudioInterleaved and hanceGetAudioInterleaved)
* or as separate channel vectors (hanceAddAudio and hanceGetAudio). We demonstrate how to add
* audio from a std::vector containing channel interleaved float values below:
*
* ```
* // We read PCM audio from the file in the 32-bit floating point format
* hanceAddAudioInterleaved (processorHandle, audioBuffer.data(),
*                           audioBuffer.size() / numOfChannels);
* ```
* 
* The processing introduces latencies, so we need to query how many samples (if any) that are available
* before we can pick up the processed audio using hanceGetAudioInterleaved:
* 
* ```
* int numOfPendingSamples = hanceGetNumOfPendingSamples (processorHandle);
* vector<float> processedBuffer (numOfChannels * numOfPendingSamples);
* if (!hanceGetAudioInterleaved (processorHandle,
*                                processedBuffer.data(),
*                                numOfPendingSamples))
* {
*     handleError ("Unable to get audio from the HANCE audio processor.");
* }
* ```
* 
* You can add silent audio (all values set to zero) to get the processing tail caused by the
* model's latency. When you have completed the processing of the audio stream, please make sure
* to delete the HANCE processor to free its memory:
* ```
* hanceDeleteProcessor (processorHandle);
* ```
*
 * \section Performance Considerations
 *
 * The HANCE Audio Engine is a light-weight and cross-platform library, and it uses either of the
 * following libraries for vector arithmetic if available:
 * - Intel Performance Primitives
 * - Apple vDSP
 * 
 * The HANCE Audio Engine reverts to pure C++ when no compatible vector arithmetic library is available.
